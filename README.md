Welcome to the repository for news_server.

You will need to install dependencies, then set up enviornment variables.

dotenv is an npm package that handles the configuration of environment variables. Once it is installed, we can create a file called .env and store our variables in there.

An important benefit of this is that we can gitignore this file so that we do not push any sensitive information about our database and/or postgres passwords up to github.
